What is Morse code? Morse code is a system to encode letters and numbers to dash and dot signs. The duration of the dash is three times the duration of a dot. Each dot or dash is followed by period of signal absence, called a space, equal to the dot duration. Morse code was first used for communicating via telegraph. The most well-known Morse code is SOS, which is used to signal an emergency. Aside from typing dots and dash, you can also signal Morse code by turning light on and off, sounding a horn or tapping, and many more.  You can use Morse code to transmit messages easily via various means if the recipient understands Morse code. If they don’t, they can use our cipher tool to find out the password, secret number, or any info you want to relay. 
Since people rarely communicate via telegraph, nowadays there are very few people who can memorize Morse codes. Instead, it has become a way to encode something or special characters for special purposes. Of course, these special characters are still widely used in many situations, you don’t know when you are going to really need it. It’s a useful language to know even if you just want to learn cryptography or cryptogram for fun. 
How Morse is useful for you:
1.	Tell others when you are in a dangerous situation (SOS).
2.	Hide your secret number or password via dots and dashes. 
3.	Cipher/ Decipher hidden clues in games. 
4.	Learn cryptography or cryptogram through learning Morse codes. 
5.	Become a codebreaker by breaking secret codes in real time translation. 
6.	And many more!
